## Jujutsu Repositories

Don't assume a repository uses Git, most of them are using Jujutsu.

The layout of most Jujutsu repositories looks something like this:

@  xsylloqz email@example.com 2026-01-16 09:11:56 097cb3d1
│  (no description set)
│ ○  lqzpqmqy email@example.com 2026-01-15 11:18:08 d7a4d743

│  ✨ feat(scope-3): Add some new cool features

Layout:

- Everything after the empty `dev` commit is considered private.
- Everything between `master` and `dev` is considered shared and in review.
- In order to deploy code we need a bookmark (aka branch) and we need to rebase
  between `master` and `dev`.
- In the above example, `bookmark-1` and `bookmark-2` are two branches with PRs.
