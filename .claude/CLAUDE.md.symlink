# Important

## Notifications
Use the CLI `notify <message>` to notify the user.

## Contributing Code

1. Try keeping things as simple as possible, but no simpler.
2. Favor functions over classes.
3. Follow established codebase patterns.

## Jujutsu Repositories

Most repositories use Jujutsu, not Git.

- `master`|`main` — production, tagged releases
- `dev` (when present) — boundary marker separating private work from PRs in review
- Revisions between `master` and `dev` — part of PRs in review
- Work above `dev` — private, not yet shared

When there's no `dev` commit, all work above `master` is treated as
in-progress. The `dev` commit is always empty and should stay empty.
