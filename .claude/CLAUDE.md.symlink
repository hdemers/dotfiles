## Obsidian Vault

When writing a report use the report-writing skill to write to the
Obsidian vault located at /home/hdemers/Dropbox/Documents/Obsidian/Grubhub/
(or might also be under /var/home/hdemers/...)

## Jujutsu Repositories

Most repositories use Jujutsu, not Git.

- `master`|`main` — production, tagged releases
- `dev` (when present) — boundary marker separating private work from PRs in review
- Revisions between `master` and `dev` — part of PRs in review
- Work above `dev` — private, not yet shared

When there's no `dev` commit, all work above `master` is treated as
in-progress. The `dev` commit is always empty and should stay empty.
