# The following creates a symlink from $SSH_AUTH_SOCK to ~/.ssh/ssh_auth_sock.
# That's part of a solution to have tmux pickup the ssh-agent socket when
# re-attaching to a session.
# See this reference https://werat.dev/blog/happy-ssh-agent-forwarding/
# The other part of the solution is to add a line to .tmux.conf to have it
# update the env variable SSH_AUTH_SOCK.
