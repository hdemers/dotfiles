# Pull Request Review

Comprehensive pull request review.

## Review Process:
1. Read PR description and linked issues (use the `ticket` tool)
2. Review code changes systematically.
3. Test functionality locally if applicable.
4. Consider possible regression issues.
5. Commented out code should not be left.
6. Leave constructive feedback.
7. Submit your feedback to the user. Do not create a PR review before approval from the user.

## Key Principle:
**Improvements scheduled for "later" must be addressed NOW!**
