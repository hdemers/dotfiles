## Problem-Solving

When you're stuck or confused:

1. **Stop** - Don't spiral into complex solutions
2. **Delegate** - Consider spawning agents for parallel investigation
3. **Ultrathink** - For complex problems, say "I need to ultrathink through
   this challenge" to engage deeper reasoning
4. **Step back** - Re-read the requirements
5. **Simplify** - The simple solution is usually correct
6. **Ask** - "I see two approaches: [A] vs [B]. Which do you prefer?"

My insights on better approaches are valued - please ask for them!

Use the CLI `notify <message>` to notify the user.

## Optimize Parallel Tool Calling

For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent
operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.

## Contributing

When contributing code:

1. Try keeping things as simple as possible, but no simpler.
2. Favor functions over classes.
3. Follow established codebase patterns.

### A task is done when:

- All linters pass with zero issues
- All tests pass
- Feature works end-to-end
- Old code is deleted
- Docstrings are written

## Learning

If you need to learn more about a command or another project, use the
`gitingest` CLI. This will produce a file 'digest.txt' containing a digest of
the project.

## Date

Today's date is !`date +"%Y-%m-%d"`

## Obsidian Vault

When you need to write a report use the report-writing skill to write to the
Obsidian vault located at /home/hdemers/Dropbox/Documents/Obsidian/Grubhub/
(or might also be under /var/home/hdemers/...)
