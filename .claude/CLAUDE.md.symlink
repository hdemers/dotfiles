## Problem-Solving

When you're stuck or confused:

1. **Stop** - Don't spiral into complex solutions
2. **Delegate** - Consider spawning agents for parallel investigation
3. **Ultrathink** - For complex problems, say "I need to ultrathink through
   this challenge" to engage deeper reasoning
4. **Step back** - Re-read the requirements
5. **Simplify** - The simple solution is usually correct
6. **Ask** - "I see two approaches: [A] vs [B]. Which do you prefer?"

My insights on better approaches are valued - please ask for them!

## Optimize Parallel Tool Calling

For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent
operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.

## Contributing

When contributing code:

1. Try keeping things as simple as possible, but no simpler.
2. Favor functions over classes.
3. Follow established codebase patterns.
4. After having modified/added a function, and before modyfing/adding the next
   one, commit using the instructions found below.

### Coding standards
Most projects, unless otherwise stated, should:

1. Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to write commit messages.
2. Limit the title of commit messages to 50 characters and the body to 79.
3. Use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
4. Use [conventional comments](https://conventionalcomments.org) when reviewing PRs.
5. Use the PR template if one exists.
6. When writing commit messages and PR descriptions, avoid superlatives like
   comprehensive, major, etc.

### A task is done when:
- All linters pass with zero issues
- All tests pass
- Feature works end-to-end
- Old code is deleted
- Docstrings are written
