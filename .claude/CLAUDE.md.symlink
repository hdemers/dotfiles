## Coding standards
Most projects, unless otherwise stated, should:

1. If is a Python project, use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) to lint and format: `ruff check` and `ruff format`.
3. Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to write commit messages.
4. Limit the title of commit messages to 50 characters and the body to 79.
5. Use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
6. Use [conventional comments](https://conventionalcomments.org) when reviewing PRs.
7. Use the PR template if one exists.
8. When writing commit messages and PR descriptions, avoid superlatives like
   comprehensive, major, etc.

## Implementation
When implementing code:

1. Try keeping things as simple as possible, but no simpler.
2. Favor functions over classes.
4. Follow established codebase patterns.
3. After having modified/added a function, commit using the conventional commit style with type `ðŸš§ wip`. Then push.
